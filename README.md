# API-INTEGRATION-AND-DATA-VISUALIZATION

COMPANY: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

NAME: TANVI BEJADI

INTERN ID: CT04DH2184

DOMAIN: PYTHON PROGRAMMING

DURATION: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH

Project Overview:
As part of the CodTech internship program, I completed a hands-on project titled "API Integration and Data Visualization using Python." The main objective of this project was to interact with a public REST API, process the fetched data using Python, and create insightful visualizations using standard data science libraries. This project integrates real-world data handling, programming logic, and presentation skills in the form of a dashboard and report, fulfilling key aspects of data-driven development.

Editor and Platform Used:
For this project, I used Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as the primary code editor due to its extensive Python support, rich extension ecosystem, and easy terminal integration. The script was developed and tested locally on a Windows 10 system using the Command Prompt for running scripts and installing libraries.

In addition, for visualization and plotting, I verified outputs by opening the generated image files (.png) and PDF reports directly from the Windows file explorer. The HTML dashboard was tested in modern web browsers such as Chrome and Edge.

Libraries and Tools Used:
The project leveraged several powerful Python libraries and tools:

Python (version 3.10 or higher)
The main programming language used to write the data processing and visualization logic.

Requests
Used for sending HTTP GET requests to the public API (https://disease.sh/v3/covid-19/countries) to retrieve live COVID-19 statistics per country.

Pandas
Used for tabular data processing and analysis. It helped transform JSON data from the API into structured DataFrames and supported sorting/filtering the data.

Matplotlib & Seaborn
These libraries were used to create high-quality visualizations. Matplotlib offered base-level customization while Seaborn provided aesthetic and informative statistical plots. Two plots were generated:

A bar chart for the top 10 countries with the highest COVID-19 cases.

A scatter plot showing the relationship between deaths and recoveries in those countries.

ReportLab
Used to generate a PDF report programmatically. The report included titles, data source reference, chart images, and a summary paragraph.

HTML/CSS
A basic HTML dashboard was created to display charts in a clean, browser-friendly layout. This can be hosted or shared as a static web visualization tool.

ZIP Archive Packaging
The final deliverables were bundled into a .zip file using Python’s zipfile module for easy submission and portability.

Applications and Real-World Relevance
This project demonstrates key skills that are highly applicable in the fields of data science, business analytics, and software development. By integrating live data from a public API, the project simulates real-world use cases such as:

Health Analytics Dashboards: Governments, health institutions, and news outlets often use such dashboards to display live pandemic statistics.

Market & Financial Analysis: Similar techniques are used for stock market dashboards, cryptocurrency trackers, and sales reports.

Environmental Monitoring: APIs from weather or pollution data providers can be used in place of COVID-19 data for climate analytics dashboards.

Automation of Reports: The PDF generation workflow is similar to what’s used in monthly performance reports, automated emails, or business intelligence tools.

This project also introduces concepts of data pipeline automation, visual storytelling, and report publishing, all of which are vital in the corporate world, particularly in roles involving data visualization, analytics, and automation.

Conclusion
The project successfully integrates API data extraction, data manipulation, visualization, and presentation — all using Python and open-source tools. It showcases my ability to build end-to-end data applications and demonstrates a strong foundation in both programming and analytical thinking. It also improves readiness for real-world tasks in domains like data analytics, reporting, automation, and dashboard development.
